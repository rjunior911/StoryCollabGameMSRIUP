You close your eyes (you think, but cannot actually tell), and try to go back to sleep. You're too worried to let your memory of yesterday catch up with you. You hear nothing but your pulse increasing, and you can't control it. You decide that you must know where you are.
1) Shout out for help.
2) Stand up.
3) Sit up, slowly and quietly.
